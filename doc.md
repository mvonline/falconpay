# **Fintech Startup Proposal**

# **Next-Generation Smart Payment Platform – Sultanate of Oman**

---

# **1\. Executive Summary**

This project aims to build Oman’s most advanced mobile-first Account-to-Account (A2A) smart payment platform, leveraging Open Banking infrastructure under the supervision of the Central Bank of Oman.

Inspired by the success of Swish, Vipps, and the digital banking agility of Revolut, this platform will be fully localized to Omani culture, regulation, and consumer behavior.

The platform is designed to:

* Replace card-based P2P transfers  
* Enable instant interbank payments  
* Reduce merchant transaction costs  
* Provide Shariah-aligned AI financial assistance  
* Support OMR and cross-border remittances  
* Digitize gifting traditions and social payments

The goal is to become the **default digital payment infrastructure layer for Oman** within 3–5 years.
